Description: Functions implementing the procedure of entropy comparison between two data samples after the renormalization of respective probability distributions with the algorithm designed by Klimontovich (Zeitschrift fur Physik B Condensed Matter. 1987, Volume 66, Issue 1, pp 125-127) and extended by Anishchenko (Proc. SPIE 2098, Computer Simulation in Nonlinear Optics. 1994, pp.130-136).  The package also includes data preparation tools which can also be used separately for various applications.
